    <h1>So, hey, hi, hello.</h1><br />
    <p>
      You can call me John, or Bằng. I don't care. I don't even know what my name is.<br /><br />
      I'm a CS major trying my best to be a pentester. I <i>kinda</i> like programming, messing around with applications, all that stuff. I also like to play games, but I don't have much time for that anymore.<br /><br />

      As you can see, I <b>suck</b> at designing websites. I don't even know how to use CSS properly. I just copy-pasted some code from the internet and modified it a bit. So, if you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know. Or you can even help me out, make this thing a little bit more... bearable. I'd appreciate that, really.<br /><br />

      I know a little bit of this and that, but I'm currently not an expert at anything. I'm currently focusing on web security, but I also want to learn about mobile security and reverse engineering. I know a little bit of Python, Java, PHP, and C/C++. I also know a little bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But I'm not an expert at any of these languages. I'm just a beginner trying to learn as much as I can.<br /><br />

      Alright, enough self-deprecation. Please go to the Contact page.<br /><br />
